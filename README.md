# 2-Player-JAVA-Game

The game developed intents to bring the fun and simplicity of a “run” game. The theme of the game is based on the traditional “levadas” existing in Madeira Island. 
The simplicity of this game makes it an ideal candidate for implementing advanced concepts of Object Oriented Programming.

Main goals of this project:
* Understanding the object-oriented programming paradigm and applying its concepts in the game;
* Implementing the Greenfoot functionalities demanded for the game;
* Developing creativity and creative thinking skills and techniques;
* Managing the time efficiently;
* Ability to work as a team;
* Ability to effectively communicate and analyze the results;

### Programming Environment

Greenfoot teaches object orientation with Java. Create “actors” which live in “worlds” to build games, simulations, and other graphical programs.
The actors are programmed in standard textual Java code, providing a combination of programming experience in a traditional text-based language with visual execution.

### Game Overview

The “Madeira TrailRun” is a 2-player run game where the players control the running characters, and the characters must avoid obstacles.
Characters are the main playable people in Madeira TrailRun. Before playing, you have to enter the name for these two characters (players). Although the characters appear different, their abilities and behavior are almost the same. At first, each player has five lives. One player loses when his character has no more lives left.
The game has two difficulty levels, the normal one, and the hard level in which the speed of obstacles increases.

#### Items:

There are items in the game that helps the player win/lose:
* The boot is an earning-points item. Every time the player collects a boot, the player’s score will increase;
* The log and the rock are losing-life items. The player must avoid touching these obstacles, otherwise the character will lose a life;
* The “special-attack” rock is used for attacking the other player’s character. This feature is available when the player earned at least 10 points (boots);
* The poncha is a special item which inverts the control keys.
